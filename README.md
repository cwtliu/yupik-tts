# yupik-tts
The planned layout

1) Segment a body of text into words
2) Fuctions that segment words into unit-level
ex. pissuryullrunrituk -> pissur yull run ri tuk
  - elongated vowel ending phonemes and consonant ending morphemes occur in a full second
  - all other vowel endings and endings gemination occur in 1/4 second
3) Search for phoneme audio clip
4) Concatenate phoneme sounds to form a word


audiofiles directory
any unit file with a 1 shows a 'hard' consonant so rr instead of r
